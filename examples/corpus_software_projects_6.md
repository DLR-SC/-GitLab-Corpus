Difference to corpus \#5 https://www.diffchecker.com/iLthsZrM

Projects that are falsely considered as software projects, with the new threshold: 5
Projects that are correctly considered as software projects, with the new threshold: 19

The projects that are falsely considered as software projects are example projects, which could also be sorted out,
if needed. 
Through the comparisons made, I have now found a good threshold to filter out software projects from other projects.
